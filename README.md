# Hi!
<!--brief-->
As a software developer, I'm passionate about code architecture and performance.
Eager to work on the server-side of applications and the foundational structure of games.
I follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure that software aligns closely with the understanding of the problem domain.
My experience with games has provided a deep understanding of the patterns and practices essential for creating high-quality software.

I have the most experience with C# language within the .NET 8 and Unity Engine.
Also, I'm happy to use Python, Bash, JavaScript or whatever best fits the problem at the time.

Currently, I'm working with the server part of applications and games at [Pixel Storm Game Studio](https://pixelstorm.pl/).
